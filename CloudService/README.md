# Deployment of Cloud Server

2) Make sure maven is installed on the system.

3) Navigate to the folder where pom file is present and execute the following commnad. </br>
	`mvn package`

4) The maven will build the project. Once the build is completed, a war file with name 'j2ee.war' is generated in the target folder.

5) This war file can be used to deploy the application on any server, here we are doing it on Amazon AWS Beanstalk.

Example:
Deploying was on Amazon Aws beanstalk. </br>

	2) Go to beanstalk dash board </br>
	3) Select a existing beanstalk instance or create a new one and select Tomcat as server </br>
	4) If creating new one provide the war file when creating the server </br>
	5) If exisiting, upload the new war file to replace the old one </br>
	6) Once successfully deployed, use application link to access the application </br>
